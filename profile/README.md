## Hi there 👋

Our goal is to create the ultimate in gamemastering tools. We hope to create an app that can do everything from World Building 🌎 to Encounter Planning ⚔ to Session Running 🏃‍♂️💨
and every step in between! For a full list of features check out the [features section](#features) below!

## Pricing 💲

We will have open access to our public [API](https://api.gamemstr.app) so that anyone can build a third-party app on top of the Gamemstr API. The base level of the first-party
Gamemstr app which will include limited access to the private API will be **free forever**, however, as we continue development we may create paid tiers that allow for more
private Worlds, Campaigns, Players, etc. to be created by an account. We hope to one day make this our full time jobs, but we will deliver a finished product *before* we charge
a dime.

## Features 🐜

Below is a list of features that we would like to have, it is by no means exhaustive and will continue to grow and evolve as the project does!

- [ ] A public API that anyone can contribute creations to and use creations from.
- [ ] Documentation for the public API.
- [ ] A private API that individual users can upload their creations to without exposing them to the rest of the world.
- [ ] Consistent naming and structure of data types that can be used in translating to and from the API.
- [ ] Documentation for the gamemstr-common crate.
- [ ] A first-party frontend app that supports all of the great features we have planned!

## Contributing ✍

We welcome any contributions from the community. This is a passion project for us and the better it is the prouder we will be! Shortly each public repository will have a section detailing
how to contribute! Keep an eye out if you are interested!
