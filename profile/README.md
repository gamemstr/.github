## Hi there 👋

We are a small team based in Oklahoma working on a highly flexible 💪 application to allow Game Masters to more easily World Build 🌎, Plan Encounters ⚔, Storyboard ✍️, and
Run Sessions 🏃‍♂️💨 in TTRPG campaigns all within the same application! For a full list of features check out the [features section](#features-) below! Initially we are working
toward support of the 5th edition of the world's most popular table-top role-playing game, as that is what we are the most familiar with. However, we have big plans to be able
to support various TTRPGs through help from the communities that have been built around them with the hope that we can make Gamemstr a universal tool!

## Pricing 💲

We will have open access to our public [API](https://api.gamemstr.app) which will support a basic list of Items, Spells, Creatures and more so that anyone can build a third-party
app on top of the Gamemstr API. In addition the base level of the first-party Gamemstr app, which will include limited access to the private API, will be **free forever**.
As we continue development we may create paid tiers that allow for more private Worlds, Campaigns, Players, etc. to be created by an account. We hope to one day make this our full
time jobs, but we will deliver a finished product *before* we charge a dime.

## Features 🐜

Below is a list of features that we would like to have, it is by no means exhaustive and will continue to grow and evolve as the project does!

- [ ] A public API that anyone can contribute creations to and use creations from.
- [ ] Documentation for the public API.
- [ ] A private API that individual users can upload their creations to without exposing them to the rest of the world.
- [ ] Consistent naming and structure of data types that can be used in translating to and from the API.
- [ ] Documentation for the gamemstr-common crate.
- [ ] A first-party frontend app that supports all of the great features we have planned!

## Contributing ✍

We welcome any contributions from the community. This is a passion project for us and the better it is the prouder we will be! Shortly each public repository will have a section
detailing how to contribute! Keep an eye out if you are interested!
